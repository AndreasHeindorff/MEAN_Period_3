2. Explain, generally, what is meant by a NoSQL database.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pros:

1)
NoSQL databases support storing data “as is.” Key value stores give you the ability to store simple data structures,
whereas document NoSQL databases provide you with the ability to handle a range of flat or nested structures.
Most of the data flying between systems does so as a message. Typically, the data is in one of the formats XML,JSON or
binary

2)
Being able to manage unstructured text greatly increases information and can help organizations make better decisions.
For example, advanced uses include support for multiple languages with facetted search, snippet functionality,
and word-stemming support. Advanced features also include support for dictionaries and thesauri.

3)
Because of the schema agnostic nature of NoSQL databases, they’re very capable of managing change — you don’t have
to rewrite ETL routines if the XML message structure between systems changes.

4)
SQL is the predominant language used to query relational database management systems.
Being able to structure queries so that they perform well has over the years become a thorny art.
Complex multi-table joins are not easy to write from memory.

5)
NoSQL databases handle partitioning (sharding) of a database across several servers.
If your data storage requirements grow too much, you can continue to add inexpensive
servers and connect them to your database cluster (horizontal scaling) making them work as a single data service.

6)
Since there is a number of NoSql databases and they have different functionality there is
always one that suits you best, and all of them have different functionality than the standard Relational databases.

7)
NoSQL databases provide support for a range of data structures.

8)
Because NoSql databases does not have the need to join tables they tend to be much faster than relational databases.
This enables the use of vast amount of data.

Cons:

1)
In contrast, most of the NoSQL database alternatives have just barely made it out of the pre-production stages,
and there are many important features that have not yet been implemented. It’s an exciting prospect for a developer
to be teetering on the cutting edge of technology, but caution must be exercised to avoid any disastrous consequences.

2)
Each NoSQL database in contrast tends to be open-source, with just one or two firms handling the support angle.
Many of them have been developed by smaller startups which lack the resources to fund support on a global scale,
and also the credibility that the established RDBMS vendors like Oracle, IBM and Microsoft enjoy.

3)
Simple queries require some programming knowledge, and the most common business intelligence tools that
many enterprises rely on do not offer connectivity to NoSQL databases. However, this may be solved in time,
seeing as some tools like PIG or HIVE have been created to offer ad-hoc query functionality for NoSQL databases.

4)
Since NoSql databases come in variates they do not have a common language with which you could query your database.
